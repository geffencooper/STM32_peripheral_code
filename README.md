# STM32_peripheral_code

This repo contains the peripheral interface code for the STM32F303. The relevant source files can be found in the MDK-ARM folder. These are used for interfacing with servos, HC-SR04, UART, etc. This repo is a work in progress as more peripherals are being ported from the old Arduino interface.  

The main project repo is here: https://github.com/geffencooper/sparrowhawk
